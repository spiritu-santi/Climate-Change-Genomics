# Climate-Change-Genomics

Files needed to run the results from:

Aguirre-Liguori A, Ramírez-Barahona S, Gaut B. 2021. The evolutionary genomics of species’ responses to climate change (under review)

- The data directory contains the datasets necessary to conduct the analyses (all other files are generated within the script).
- The code directory contains R scripts to perform the analyses and plot the results (NOTE: some of the resulting plots were edited in Adobe Illustrator to obtain the final figures).
