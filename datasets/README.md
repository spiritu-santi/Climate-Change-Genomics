## Data
- Here we provide all necessary data to run the code in an 'input' directory.  
- All other files are created and saved in an 'output' directory.  
- Given the long runtimes of *fastsimcoal2*, we include an 'SFS_inputs_runned' directory with the results of runs performed on the data. Users have the option to run the *fastsimcoal2* simualtions within the code, which will overwrite the files in this folder.  

## Intructions to download and compile software needed to run the code:
MAXENT -> input/  
FASTSIMCOAL2 -> input/  

## Data needed to be downloaded before running the code:
1) Climate data: here we used the bioclimatic variables of WorldClim v.1.4:
    - Present-day variables available at https://www.worldclim.org/data/v1.4/worldclim14.html.
      - download folder: input/present
    - Future variables available at https://www.worldclim.org/data/v1.4/cmip5_30s.html. 
      - download folder: input/year_50 , input/year_70
